Strategy and Product Requirements for the Bulgarian Dental Association (BZS) Digital Portal
Executive summary
The Bulgarian Dental Association (BZS) currently operates a website (bzs.bg) that provides information on its structure, regulatory documents, continuing education, a public register and basic news items. The site is largely static and requires users to navigate to separate domains to access services such as the register of dentists
bzs.bg
. To serve the needs of dentists, students, dental partners/providers and Bulgarian citizens more effectively, BZS plans a comprehensive digital portal. The vision is to transform bzs.bg into a modern, multilingual and accessible service and information hub that supports dental professionals in their practice, delivers trustworthy oral‑health information to the public, and enhances BZS’s ability to advocate and manage professional affairs.
Market & competitive analysis
Current BZS site (bzs.bg)
Navigation – The existing site is organised around structural information (governing bodies, committees), normative documents and continuing education. A public register section links out to a separate domain for member login and search
bzs.bg
. News and event information are presented as blog posts
bzs.bg
, and there are links to the Dentamedica newspaper and an online journal【302102504626677†L92-L98】.
Limitations – The design is not responsive; navigation is deep and oriented around internal committees rather than user needs; digital services (membership renewal, course registration) are not integrated; there is no English‑language version or accessible design; the public cannot easily verify dentists’ credentials or access oral health resources.

Deployment & migration (10–12 months) – Launch the portal with a phased roll‑out; migrate existing content and user data; provide support and gather feedback for iterative improvements.
Conclusion
Modernising the bzs.bg portal offers BZS an opportunity to become a leading example of digital transformation in professional associations. By adopting best practices from the American, British, German and Brazilian dental associations, the new portal should deliver valuable services for dentists, students, partners and citizens, enhance BZS’s advocacy and visibility, and contribute to improved oral‑health outcomes in Bulgaria.
