### Hero section

Mission statement:

“The Bulgarian Dental Association unites dental professionals to uphold the prestige of our profession, improve the material and scientific welfare of our members, and protect patients’ rights.”

This paraphrases the aims set out at the first BZS congress in 1905, when dentists pledged to promote and preserve the prestige of the dental profession, improve the material welfare and scientific level of members, unite practitioners, establish libraries and journals and review laws related to dentistry.

Calls to action:

Become a member – invites licensed dentists and dental students to join the association and enjoy professional support.

Find a dentist – links to the public register, helping citizens locate qualified dental professionals.

Imagery: Use a professional hero image of Bulgarian dentists caring for patients; overlay the mission statement. Include a language switcher (BG/EN). For mobile users, use a stacked layout with a hamburger menu.

Explain that after completing a course or conference session, members can download digital certificates with e‑signature. Certificates should state the course title, instructor, date and CPD credits earned. Provide guidelines on claiming credits.

### Research (/education/research)

Offer a repository of peer‑reviewed research papers and guidelines. Allow filtering by topic (e.g., periodontology, implantology, public health). Link to the Dentamedica journal (see Publications section) and provide open‑access articles when possible.

## Professional Resources (/resources)

The resources section should serve as a one‑stop library for dentists, providing access to normative documents, guidelines and practice management tools.

### Documents (/resources/documents)

Include downloadable regulations and agreements such as:

Laws and regulations: Laws governing the dental profession, Ministry of Health orders and guidelines.

National Dental Activities Contract: The National Framework Agreement (NFA) between BZS and the National Health Insurance Fund, which sets payment rates and service codes for NHIF‑covered dental procedures (see the NHIF section below).

BZS normative documents: Internal rules, professional ethics code, financial reports and meeting minutes.

Foreign documents: Translated guidelines from FDI and WHO relevant to dentistry.

Each document card should display the title, type (law, guideline, policy), publication date, language and file size. Provide search and filter options by category, year and type.

## Public Health Information (/health)

This section educates citizens on oral health and patient rights. Content should be written in accessible Bulgarian and English.

### Prevention (/health/prevention)

Explain why oral health matters. State that cavities are the most common chronic disease of childhood and adolescence and that good oral hygiene and fluoride dramatically reduce risk. Provide general prevention tips:

Brush twice a day with fluoride toothpaste and floss daily. Use small circular motions and replace your toothbrush every three to four months.

Visit the dentist regularly for check‑ups and cleanings.

Eat a balanced diet and limit sugary foods and drinks.

Avoid tobacco and excessive alcohol, as these increase risk of gum disease and oral cancer.

Use protective gear (mouthguards) during sports and follow safety guidelines.

### Children (/health/children)

Summarise the CDC’s oral health tips for infants and children:

For babies: Wipe gums twice a day with a clean cloth; start brushing with a soft toothbrush when teeth appear; visit a dentist by your baby’s first birthday. Apply fluoride varnish as soon as the first tooth erupts.

For children: Brush teeth twice a day with fluoride toothpaste; supervise brushing until children develop good skills; children under 6 should use a pea‑sized amount of toothpaste and spit it out. Encourage drinking fluoridated tap water and ask the dentist about dental sealants, which prevent up to 80 % of cavities.

Highlight that untreated cavities can lead to pain, infections and problems with eating and learning.

### Seniors (/health/seniors)

Provide tips for older adults, referencing the National Institute on Aging:

Prevent gum disease: Brush twice daily with fluoride toothpaste, floss daily, visit the dentist regularly, eat a balanced diet and quit smoking. Gum disease (periodontitis) can lead to tooth loss and is linked to chronic conditions.

Proper brushing and flossing: Use a soft‑bristle brush, small circular motions and brush along the gum line. Clean between teeth using floss or water flossers. People with limited hand mobility can use electric toothbrushes and floss holders.

Dentures: Start with soft foods, cut food into small pieces, chew slowly and clean dentures daily. Remove dentures at night to prevent swollen gums and see a dentist for adjustments.

Dry mouth: Sip water, avoid alcohol and caffeine, avoid spicy foods and talk to a dentist about artificial saliva.

Oral cancer awareness: Avoid tobacco products, limit alcohol and use lip balm with sunscreen. Advise regular oral cancer screenings.

### Emergency care (/health/emergency)

Provide first‑aid steps for dental emergencies. For a knocked‑out permanent tooth, instruct people to handle the tooth by the crown (top), avoid touching the root, rinse it gently with milk or saliva without scrubbing, attempt to reinsert it into the socket or keep it in milk or saliva and seek immediate dental care. Baby teeth should not be replanted. For toothaches, advise rinsing with warm water, flossing to remove debris and contacting a dentist. For facial swelling or injury, instruct patients to apply cold compresses and visit an emergency dentist or hospital.

### Insurance (/health/insurance)

Explain the National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) and what dental services are covered. According to the NHIF, health‑insured citizens may visit a dentist contracted with the Fund and are entitled to a package of services each calendar year. Outline coverage:

Children under 18: Up to four treatment activities per year, including fillings and tooth extractions free of charge; treatment of pulpitis or periodontitis with a small co‑payment; specialised surgical examinations. Mentally ill children receive unlimited NHIF‑funded treatment under general anaesthesia.

Adults over 18: Up to three treatment activities annually with modest co‑payments (e.g., BGN 4.00 for fillings, BGN 4.00 for extractions). Seniors aged 65–69 receive additional coverage for dentures. Pregnant women are entitled to an extra comprehensive examination.

Patients must bring their health‑insurance book to each visit; dentists record performed activities and codes. Provide a link to the official NHIF list of contracted dentists.

Clarify that services not covered by the NHIF are paid out‑of‑pocket or via supplementary insurance.

## Find a Dentist (/dentist-search)

Introduce the public register as the authoritative source for licensed dentists in Bulgaria. BZS maintains the register and updates it regularly, fulfilling its statutory duty to “manage the organisation’s property, maintain the register and direct activities”. Explain that citizens can:

Search by name or location (city, district).

Filter by specialisation, language spoken, insurance acceptance and availability.

View dentist profiles with practice address, contact details, qualifications and verification status.

Use the map view to find nearby practices and get directions.

Download the full list for offline use.

Encourage patients to always check a dentist’s registration before booking an appointment. Provide a disclaimer that the register is for informational purposes and not an endorsement.

## Events & Conferences (/events)

Describe BZS’s role in organising professional events. The flagship event is the International Scientific Congress, held every two years. The 23rd Congress will be in Burgas from 12–14 June 2025, featuring lectures, workshops, poster sessions and a dental exhibition. Registration is open on 12 June (14:00–18:00) and 13 June (8:00–13:00). Dr. Nikolay Sharkov chairs the Organising Committee and Prof. Dr. Todor Uzunov chairs the Scientific Committee. Highlight other events such as regional conferences, webinars on digital dentistry and workshops on implantology. Provide filters by category, date and location.

### Event detail page

For each event, provide:

Hero section with banner image, title, date, location and registration status.

Tabs for agenda (schedule with time slots, speakers and topics), speakers (photos and bios), location (map and venue information) and registration (fees, CPD credits, online registration form).

Encourage early registration and note any extended deadlines (e.g., for the 23rd Congress registration was extended to 12 June 2025).

## Publications & Media (/publications)

### Dentamedica (/publications/dentamedica)

Introduce “Дентамедика” as the BZS monthly newspaper. Provide a list of recent issues (e.g., 2025 Issue 7, Issue 6, etc.), each with a thumbnail, summary of key articles and a “Read” button. Offer downloads in PDF format. Emphasise that Dentamedica covers clinical updates, interviews, legal changes and association news. Invite members to submit articles.
